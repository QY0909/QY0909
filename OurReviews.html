                    <p>I'm glad to have this opportunity to learn a new keyboard layout, Colemak, and practise typing with it. Since I'm used to the QWERTY keyboard layout, it is difficult for me to practise using this new layout at first. However, I would say that Colemak is actually a <b>beginner-friendly</b> keyboard layout as it is <b>designed based on the most frequently used letters in our daily life</b>. If we have more time to practise the Colemak keyboard layout, I believe it will result in smoother and more efficient typing. In my opinion, <b>the Colemak keyboard layout should be introduced to more keyboard users around the world</b>.</p>

                    <p>In my opinion, learning colemak is similar to gaining more general knowledge. It's interesting to experiment with new things, as when I used Colemak for seven days. While at first it was challenging, for me it is typical,because I now understand how the letters are arranged in Colemak. Because <b>the most often used letters are close to our fingertips</b>, clicking other letters is quick, but because I'm not moving my hands, my wrists begin to ache. Therefore, even though I have to move my hands, <b>I prefer the QWERTY keyboard because I've been using it for years without experiencing any hand pain</b>.</p>

                    <p>I learn Colemak on a website called <b>'Colemak Club'</b>. On the website, there are many levels. Each level will get harder. I practiced the Colemak keyboard for 1 week on the website. On the first day, it was hard for me to use Colemak keyboard, but on the following days I can catch up with it. On the Colemak keyboard,<b> the most common letters occupy the home row</b>,so it might be easier for new users who want to use the keyboard for the first time. Even though I can catch up with Colemak ,I still get confused about the keys to QWERTY keys sometimes. I would say that <b>the experience for me when learning Colemak was fun</b>. For me, <b>I still prefer QWERTY even though I easily catch up with Colemak because I have used the QWERTY keyboard since an early age</b>. Comparing between QWERTY and Colemak, QWERTY is the one that works for me.</p>

                    <p>When I first learn new keyboard, it's really hard actually because I already used with QWERTY keyboard arrangement. After learning for 15 minutes each day, I had discovered some advantages and disadvantages in using Colemak keyboard. The most obvious one is <b>Colemak changed how long I'm able to type without feeling pain on my fingertips</b>. However, the <b>possibility to get typewriter jamming is higher</b>. If I have to choose one keyboard for daily use, I would prefer QWERTY. However, <b>If I had a chance to learn Colemak keyboard for a longer period, my preference might change in the future</b>. </p>
